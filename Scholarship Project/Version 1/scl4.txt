There are various ways to track your spending effieciently. You can use programs such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to be able to write your spending habits in clear and effective spreadshet, or you could use paper and pen to be able to write down each purchase made (for this technique, you can staple reciepts to it), or lastly (and most effectivly), you can use this application to track spending. If you go to the first page of this application, called the spending tracker, you are able to use the feature which is located on the left hand side of the frame. With each purchase made, you are able to record data about your purchases. This is espically helpful if you make purchases online, as the applicaiton will be increadibly easy to accessible.

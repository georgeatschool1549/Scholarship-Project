Budgeting cannot happen, however, if you are not aware of how to save and spend appropriatly. This is a crucial step in improving your financial literacy because knowing the balence between spending and saving is crucial, yet difficult. One way to overcome this challenge is to record your spending habits over a period of time. This way, you are able to see if the choice you made was appropriate. For example, if someone were to purchase designer clothes instead of purchasing normal clothes, they may reflect that it was not the best decision, and future choices may be more wise. This is an extreme example to simply show the effect of it, however, this can apply for simple products such as buying high quality food versus store brand food. The margin of savings may be small, but it can add up over time. This application has its very own spending tracker, which you can use on the first page of this applicaiton.

Budgeting is a popular technqiue that is used to assist people in saving money. In a nutshell, budgetting is the act of creating a set of goals, and aiming to reach them. The goals are set by taking into consideration the persons income, expenses, and how much money they wish to save. For example, if someone is earning $60,000 a year, and they spend $30,000 on rent, $15,000 on food, $8000 on transport (total expenses:53,000), they can then aim to save $7000 a year. This is just an example, however, and there are many different ways to create a budget. According to Investopedia,'Budgeting can help you set long-term financial goals, keep you from overspending, help shut down risky spending habits, and more.'
